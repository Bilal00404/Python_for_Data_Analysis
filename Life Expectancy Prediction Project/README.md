# About Project
In this project I have bulid and evaluated multiple linear regression model on "Life Expectancy Data".

The steps I followed to complete this project are:
1. Import the dataset.

2. Clean the data:
    * Set column names
    * Deal with missing values

3. Contruct visualizations:
    * Created boxplots to see the spreadness of data
    * Created histograms to see the distribution of data

4. Contruct the multiple linear regression model:
    * Isolate modeling variables
    * Splitted data into train and test sets
    * Fit the model on training data

5. Evaluate the model:
    * Evaluated the trained model on training data
        * Coefficient of determination.
        * RMS
    * Evaluated the trained model on test data
        * Coefficient of determination.
        * RMS 
 
6. Executed model result:
    * Calculated residuals
    * Created scatterplot between predicted and actual values
    * Find Coefficients


# About Dataset
