# Heart Disease Prediction


## Project Roadmap
    - Here is the roadmap I have built to complete this project:
        * Import the data
        * Preprocess the data
        * calculate descriptive statistics  
        * Exploratory data analysis
        * Construct the Logistic Regression model
        * Evaluate the Logistic Regression model
        * Construct the Decision Tree model
        * Evaluate the Decision Tree model
        * Project key findings
